# Profile Creation Issues - Fixes Applied

## 🔍 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Role Name Mismatch**
**Problem**: Test scripts used `'organization'` role while database expected `'org_admin'`
**Fix**: Updated all test account configurations to use `'org_admin'` instead of `'organization'`

### 2. **Column Name Mismatches in Test Scripts**
**Problems**:
- Used `phone` instead of `phone_number`
- Used `id` instead of `profile_id` in profile tables
- Used `years_of_experience` instead of `years_experience`
- Used `education` instead of `education_background`
- Missing required fields like `license_body`, `national_id_number`, `languages_spoken`

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated `create-test-accounts.js` to use correct column names
- ✅ Added missing required fields for therapist profiles
- ✅ Added missing required fields for organization profiles
- ✅ Fixed user metadata structure to include all required fields

### 3. **Migration File Column Mismatches**
**Problems**:
- Migration used `languages` instead of `languages_spoken`
- Migration used `years_of_experience` instead of `years_experience`
- Migration included deprecated columns like `hourly_rate_ugx`, `availability_schedule`, `is_verified`, `verification_status`

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated migration to use correct column names matching the schema
- ✅ Removed deprecated columns from therapist profile creation
- ✅ Added required fields: `license_body`, `national_id_number`
- ✅ Added default values for required fields

### 4. **Profile Creation Logic Issues**
**Problems**:
- Test script manually inserted into profiles table, bypassing triggers
- Potential race conditions between trigger execution and profile creation

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Removed manual profile insertion from test script
- ✅ Added delay and verification to ensure trigger-based profile creation works
- ✅ Let the `handle_new_user` trigger handle all profile creation automatically

## 📋 Files Modified

### 1. `create-test-accounts.js`
- Fixed role names: `'organization'` → `'org_admin'`
- Fixed column names: `id` → `profile_id`, `phone` → `phone_number`, etc.
- Added missing required fields for all profile types
- Removed manual profile insertion, relying on database triggers
- Added proper user metadata structure

### 2. `supabase/migrations/20250623000000-comprehensive-missing-features.sql`
- Fixed therapist profile creation:
  - `languages` → `languages_spoken`
  - `years_of_experience` → `years_experience`
  - Added `license_body` and `national_id_number` fields
  - Removed deprecated columns
- Added proper default values for required fields

### 3. `test-accounts-config.js`
- Updated demo organization role from `'organization'` to `'org_admin'`

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. **Get Supabase Service Role Key**
- Follow instructions in `GET_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.md`
- Update `test-accounts-config.js` with actual service role key
- Or set environment variable: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### 2. **Test the Migration**
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop first
# Then reset the database to apply all migrations
npx supabase db reset
```

### 3. **Test Account Creation**
```bash
# After setting up service role key
node create-test-accounts.js
```

### 4. **Verify Profile Creation**
After running the test script, verify in Supabase dashboard that:
- Users are created in `auth.users`
- Profiles are created in `public.profiles` with correct roles
- Role-specific profiles are created in:
  - `public.individual_profiles` for individuals
  - `public.therapist_profiles` for therapists
  - `public.organization_profiles` for org_admins

## 🔧 Key Improvements Made

### Database Trigger (`handle_new_user`)
- ✅ Now uses correct column names matching the actual schema
- ✅ Includes all required fields with proper defaults
- ✅ Handles role-based profile creation automatically
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

### Test Account Creation
- ✅ Follows proper user creation flow through Supabase Auth
- ✅ Lets database triggers handle profile creation
- ✅ Includes comprehensive user metadata
- ✅ Uses correct role names and column mappings

### Data Consistency
- ✅ All role names now match database enums
- ✅ All column names match actual table schemas
- ✅ Required fields are properly populated
- ✅ Default values prevent null constraint violations

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After applying these fixes and setting up the service role key:

1. **Automatic Profile Creation**: When users register, profiles will be created automatically via the database trigger
2. **Role-Based Profiles**: Users will get the appropriate profile type based on their role
3. **Complete Data**: All required fields will be populated with either user data or sensible defaults
4. **Test Accounts**: The test script will successfully create all configured test accounts
5. **Therapist Fetching**: The therapist listing functionality will work because therapist profiles will be properly created

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [ ] Service role key configured
- [ ] Database reset successful (migrations applied)
- [ ] Test accounts created successfully
- [ ] Profiles table populated with correct roles
- [ ] Individual profiles created for 'individual' users
- [ ] Therapist profiles created for 'therapist' users
- [ ] Organization profiles created for 'org_admin' users
- [ ] Therapist listing page shows therapists
- [ ] No 401 authentication errors
- [ ] No column name mismatch errors
- [ ] No role enum constraint violations

All the code fixes have been applied. The remaining step is to configure the Supabase service role key and test the complete flow.
